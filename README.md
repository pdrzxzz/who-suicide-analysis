# WHO Suicide Analysis

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the World Health Organization (WHO) suicide dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes global suicide data to identify patterns, trends, and factors that may influence suicide rates across different countries, age groups, and demographics.

## 🚀 How to use
Just click the Open in Colab button, the plots are generated with plotly, so in github they do not show up

## 📦 Dependencies

The project uses these libraries:
- **numpy** & **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn**: Data visualization
- **kagglehub**: Data source access

## 🎨 What i learned  

Data analysis is not about desscribing what you see in the plots, its explain why you plotted that, highlighting interesting patterns and raise questions.
It's about using external knowledge and research to form and back up hypotheses to explain patterns.
